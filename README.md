## Project Reflection

This project was built during my Masters. It was my addicional learning and projects in web application sector.


### Project Description
The To-Do List is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks, providing a simple and intuitive interface for task management.


### Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by entering the task description and clicking the "Add" button.  
Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.  
Edit Tasks: Users can edit the description of existing tasks by clicking an "Edit" button, making changes, and saving the updates.  
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking a "Delete" button next to each task.  
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.  


### Technologies Used
JavaScript: Handles the logic for adding, editing, marking as completed, and deleting tasks, as well as updating the user interface dynamically.  
HTML: Structures the content of the application, including input fields, buttons, and the task list.  
CSS: Styles the application to create an appealing and user-friendly interface, with responsive design principles.  


The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
